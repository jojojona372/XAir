% Description:
% Generates the data that XAir needs, and stores it in a file for later
% use. It's much faster than generating this data every time XAir is used.
% XAirDataGen was written by Jos Havinga, Bram Harbers, and Wiard van der Weijden.
% It was improved for ease of use by Jona van der Pal.
% Also utilises gasprop, written by e.s.j.beitler@student.utwente.nl

% First create vectors with all values of temperature to be evaluated:
Trange = linspace(Tmin,Tmax,N);
% Do the same for pressure, but use a logarithmic scale as follows:
Prange = exp(linspace(log(Pmin), log(Pmax), N));
% With Prange and Trange, a grid of pressure and temperature can be
% created:
[Tgrid,Pgrid] = meshgrid(Trange,Prange); 
% To store the enthalpy and entropy, create an array of size N by N with
% NaN values (indeed, enthalpy could also be stored in a vector only as it
% is not a function of pressure):
hgrid = NaN(N);
sgrid = NaN(N);

% As enthalpy is only a function of temperature, it is sufficient to create
% a loop that runs over all temperatures.
% First, the enthalpy at the reference temperature (the first temperature)
% is already known. Therefore, the first column of the enthalpy grid is
% known:
hgrid(:,1) = href;
% Then, create a loop that runs over all other values of temperature. From
% the 2nd until the N'th temperature:
for i = 2:N
    % For all pressures (row numbers) the enthalpy will be the the same.
    % Therefore, the full column can be determined at once. The difference
    % in enthalpy with respect to the reference state can be determined
    % with gasprop:
    hgrid(:,i) = href + gasprop('air', Tref, Trange(i));
end

% Then, the entropy must be determined. Entropy is function of pressure and
% temperature. Therefore, a double for loop must be used. The outer loop
% runs over all pressures, and the inner loop over all temperatures:
% For first pressure value until N'th pressure value:
for i = 1:N
    % For the first (reference) temperature, equation (2) from the exercise
    % sheet must be used:
    sgrid(i,1) = sref - R*log(Pgrid(i,1)/Pref);
    % For the second until the N'th temperature, another for loop must be
    % used:
    for j = 2:N
        % To determine the entropy change from the previous temperature
        % until the current, the specific heat capacity at constant
        % pressure must be known. This is a function of temperature.
        % Therefore, the average value in between the previous and the
        % current temperature will be used to determine this value. This
        % average temperature is:
        meanTemp = (Tgrid(i,j-1) + Tgrid(i,j))/2;
        % And the specific heat capacity at constant pressure at this
        % temperature can be determined with gasprop:
        c_p = gasprop('air',meanTemp);
        % With this c_p, the new entropy can be determined with equation
        % (7) from the exercise sheet. sgrid(i,j-1) is the entropy at the
        % previous temperature, Tgrid(i,j-1) is the previous temperature,
        % and Tgrid(i,j) is the current temperature:
        sgrid(i,j) = sgrid(i,j-1) + c_p*log(Tgrid(i,j)/Tgrid(i,j-1));

%% Create interpolation functions
tic
% Now, the data that is created can be used to create a set of
% interpolation functions. For the scatteredInterpolant and the
% griddedInterpolant functions, the output will be a function in itself.
% The chosen names are as follows: T_ps for example means temperature (T)
% as function of pressure (p) and enthropy (s).

% Enthalpy is a function of temperature only. Therefore, the functions h_T
% and T_h can be created, using the griddedInterpolant. For these fits,
% only one row of the Tgrid and hgrid arrays are needed:
% Enthalpy as function of temperature
h_T = griddedInterpolant(Tgrid(1,:),hgrid(1,:));
% Temperature as function of enthalpy
T_h = griddedInterpolant(hgrid(1,:),Tgrid(1,:));

% For the functions created with scatteredInterpolant, the data must be
% entered as a vector instead of an array. To convert an array to a vector,
% use (:). Therefore, the following functions can be created:
% Temperature as function of pressure and entropy
T_ps = scatteredInterpolant(Pgrid(:),sgrid(:),Tgrid(:));
% Enthalpy as function of presssure and entropy
h_ps = scatteredInterpolant(Pgrid(:),sgrid(:),hgrid(:));
% Pressure as function of enthalpy and entropy
p_hs = scatteredInterpolant(hgrid(:),sgrid(:),Pgrid(:));
% Pressure as function of temperature and entropy
p_Ts = scatteredInterpolant(Tgrid(:),sgrid(:),Pgrid(:));
% Entropy as function of temperature and pressure
s_Tp = scatteredInterpolant(Tgrid(:),Pgrid(:),sgrid(:));
% Entropy as function of enthalpy and pressure
